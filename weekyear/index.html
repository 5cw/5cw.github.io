  This is an incomplete unserious proposal for fun.

  <h3>
    The year is divided into 7 months
  </h3>
  <h3>
    Each month is divided into 7 or 8 weeks
  </h3>
  <h3>
    Weeks are divided into the standard 7 days.

  <table id="calendar">

  <div id="today"></div>

  <p>Years are grouped into 7-Year <b>"Cycles,"</b></p>
  <p>Cycles are grouped into 7-Cycle <b>"Periods,"</b></p>
  <p>Periods are grouped into <b>"Ages,"</b></p>
  <p>Ages are grouped into <b>"Superdays,"</b></p>
  <p>Superdays are grouped into <b>"Superweeks,"</b> </p>
  <p>Superages are grouped into <b>"Supersuperyears,"</b></p>
  <p>and so on, adding more prefixes of Super- until society collapses, we decide to start a new calendar from scratch,
    or both.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Frimonth, Saturmonth, and Sunmonth always have an Endweek. </p>
  <p>Thursmonth has an Endweek every Sunyear. This is called a Cycle leap. This offsets the length of a standard year
    being 364 days.</p>
  <p>Wednesmonth has an Endweek every 29 years. This is called a Correction leap. This offsets the length of a real year
    being 365.2422 days. The first Correction leap is </p>
  <p>Tuesmonth has an Endweek approximately every 3.6 Superdays. This is called a Super leap and offsets a bit of the
    remaining drift. </p>
  <p>This is a long enough period of time that the Earth's rotation cannot be predicted, and should
    therefore be inserted as needed by scholars of the time. </p>
  <p>(this is also about as much drift as the Gregorian calendar has at present, and could be left out if you are
    pessimistic about the age of humanity)</p>
  <p>Most years are 364 days, some are 371 days, about every 2 centuries a year is 378 days, and about once every couple
    million years a year is 385 days.</p>
  <br>
  <p>A day of the year can be written using their first or other letters or numbers which represent their corresponding
    units of time. </p>
  <p>Thurs-units and Sun-units can be written with H or R and U or N respectively (to disambiguate them from Tues-units
    and Satur-units).</p>
  <p>So Sunday, Thursweek, Tuesmonth would be NRT or 631. Monday, Endweek, Frimonth would be MEF or 074. There's no need
    for separators </p>
  <p>because they can't take up more than one digit. The numerical representation can thus be thought of as a right to
    left mixed-radix senary/octal number, so Mon-units are 0.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Monday, Monweek, Monmonth, Monyear 0000 (omitting digits/units to the right defaults to Mon-units) is pegged to
    Monday, September 3rd, 1894 in the Gregorian calendar.</p>
  <p>(The first federally recognized Labor Day in the United States.)</p>
  <p>(I am aware there is some contention about the US not recognizing May Day, and choosing Labor Day as a smaller
    concession, and that the actions and recognition of </p>
  <p>the United States government should be valued as less important than grassroots organizing, it was mostly about
    making Saturmonth and Sunmonth roughly correspond to summer vacation.)</p>
